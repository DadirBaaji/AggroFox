# Solar Power

This device has to have a solar panel to reduce the cost of infrastructure.

We reccomend that you use at least a 2W Solar panel in tandem with a LiPo Battery like in the following circuit:

The power segment of the circuit is intended to power the circuit via Solar Power during the day and then charge the LiPo battery so it can continue working at night.

For this purpose you can see the Regulator in the image that is a connection module that regulates the LiPo battery charge and the Solar Panel feeding energy to the system.

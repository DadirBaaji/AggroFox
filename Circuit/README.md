# Circuit Characteristics

For the realization of the complete circuit, we use the Pycom port to send information to Sigfox and the Arduino Mini Pro as controller of the sensors, the communication between these two devices of hara by means of serial communication at 9600 baud.

- Arduino Mini Pro (or any other board).
- Pycom FyPy Board (or SyPy).
- Moisture sensor.
- DHT11 Sensor.
- DS18B20 Sensor.
- 3 Resistances of 1kohm.
- 1 Resistance of 4.7kohm.
- Cable, Welding, Jump wire or similar.

# Irrigation system via Open weather Forecast and Particle Photon. 

We have to explain first the why's before the know how's.

The use of tracking the forecast of the weather is the main purpose of the project itself, that is to optimize water usage.

What use there is of having a sensor that tracks that the soil is dry and activate an irrigation system with that info, but it is going to rain that same day?

We can save a lot of water simply by using the weather forecast systems available to notify our platform that it is going to rain and stop from using water that day.

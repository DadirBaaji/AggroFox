# Agrofox

Congratulations! You are here to learn how to configure our Agrofox application in a simple way so you can take your trip to the wonderful technology of Sigfox and its application with pages like Bluemix and Thingspeak.

# Thingspeak Configuration

Through the platform of Sigfox https://backend.sigfox.com we will use its callback tools to make the publication of the page of things, for it the first part for the configuration of the data channel in https: //thingspeak.com

1.- Sign in or Create a free account.

2.- Create your Channel and it creates all the fields it requires for your data (Maximum 12, because the sigfox technology only allows 12 bytes per package of information sent), in the case of our application there will be 6 fields.

Our Fields:

- Temperature Earth [C째]
- Moisture Earth [%]
- Heat Index Earth [C째]
- Temperature Air [C째]
- Humidity Air [%]
- Heat Index Air [C째]

5.1.- In this section we have to configure 2 fundamental things, the data we will receive in Sigfox and how we will send them to the website, in this case for our application we will receive 6 bytes of information, which are declared "Custom payload config" , for example:

Let's look at this variable: tempe :: uint: 8

- Name of the variable ---> tempe
- Type of variable ---> uint (variable unsigned int)
- Bit length of the data ---> 8

This is the payload that we will send with all our variables:

"tempe::uint:8 hume::uint:8 inde::uint:8 tempa::uint:8 huma::uint:8 inda::uint:8"

5.2.- To do the POST html that requires the Thingspeak app and thus upload data in the graphics, we need to put in the "Url pattern" the following address with the following data.

"https://api.thingspeak.com/update.json?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&field1={customData#tempe}&field2={customData#hume}&field3={customData#inde}&field4={customData#tempa}&field5={customData#huma}&field6={customData#inda}"

Explaining a bit that is each part of the link:

- In the part of the link that says YOUR_API_KEY it is necessary to put the writing API for thingspeak.

- The variables that are in brackets {customData#tempe}, "tempe" is the name of each of the variables declared in the payload.

6.- In the "Use HTTP Method" section, you have to select the GET option.

7.- Once finished that we put on the sign "OK" and the application will be created.

# Next Step

Once this has been configured, now you have to configure the pycom with the corresponding .py file as indicated in the Pycom Code folder.
